During the last few weeks of SDS348, we have been learning some of the basics in Python. While my first instinct was to stick to what I know best (R), Python has proven itself to be pretty interesting and versatile, although I will have to put a lot more work into it before I consider myself to know how to use it. There are quite a few differences between R and Python, but two of the most basic differences come across when indexing in either program and when you come across a type of dataframe called a dictionary.

In R, indexing begins at 1, but in Python, indexing begins at zero. This is shown below. 

```{r}
listR <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
listR[1]
```
```{python}
listPy=[1,2,3,4]
listPy[1]
```


In Python, you can create dictionaries, which are unordered collections of key:value pairs. Below, I have made a dictionary that pertains to Teddy, my family's dog. 
```{python}
teddy_dict = {
  'firstName': 'Theodore', 
  'lastName': 'Bardenhagen', 
  'likes': ['sleeping','lounging on the couch','guarding the backyard'], 
  'dislikes': ['squirrels', 'men' ,'touchy people'], 
  'age': 8
}
```
After making this dictionary, you can view all or parts of it (as shown below), or modify it.
```{python}
teddy_dict
teddy_dict['dislikes']
```

One of the most interesting things I learned about Python is that it "plays well" with R: using reticulate, you can share information across code chunks. A simple example is as follows: 

```{r}
library(reticulate)
example <- "We start out in R,"
```
```{python}
example=" then we can switch to Python."
print(r.example, example)
```
Clearly, this not a very useful example, but it's interesting! This would be very helpful when working with Python- or R- specific functions in the future. Below is another example, also integrating regex: 

```{r}
string1 <- "We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\',\' is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking"
```
```{python}
import re
re.findall(r"\d+", r.string1)
```
Pretty nifty!

I would like to give a big thank you to Dr. Woodward for teaching this wonderful class! At times I felt like this:

but I eventually figured everything out, and I'm incredibly glad I did!
